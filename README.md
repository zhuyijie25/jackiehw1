# HOMEWORK # 1

**Objective:** This homework exercise is intended to start getting you comfortable with **multi-person collaboration in GitHub**. :octocat:

### Instructions:

#### (a) add collaborators

In class, you identified the **person to your left** and the **person to your right**
1. you'll receive a `pull request` from the **person to your left**, so please add them as a collaborator to this homework repo (and send them a **Slack DM** to let them know they have been added so they can proceed with the instructions below)
2. you'll make a `pull request` to that homework repo from the **person to your right**, so ask to be added as a collaborator to their homework repo (you'll get a **Slack DM** from that person when you've been added)

#### (b) [on your own homework repo]: clone and add a script

1. select a location in your machine and clone your homework repo locally
2. create a folder called `src`
2. add any script file with code to the `src` folder (from any other class or from your own past work)
3. `push` this file back to your own homework repo

#### (c) clone a repo and create a pull request

1. go to a brand new location on your machine, and **clone the repo from the person to your right**
3. (checkout and) create a branch
3. make a change in the code file from the cloned repo (you'll find it in the `src` folder)
4. verify that git is tracking the change
5. `commit` the changes with a meaningful message
6. `push` to the other person's repository (now, you've created a pull request)
8. notify the **person to your right** via **Slack DM** to review your pull request and merge it back to their repository


#### (d) [on your own homework repo]: review and merge the pull request you received

1. review the pull request from the **person to your left**
2. `merge` back to your own repo
